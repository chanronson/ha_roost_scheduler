# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Roost Scheduler integration is experiencing critical issues that prevent proper operation in Home Assistant. The system has multiple blocking I/O operations that violate Home Assistant's async requirements, version migration failures causing data corruption, and backup recovery failures that leave users unable to restore their schedule data. This feature addresses these core stability and data integrity issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Blocking I/O Operations

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want the Roost Scheduler integration to operate without blocking the event loop, so that my Home Assistant instance remains responsive and doesn't generate warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration system performs file operations THEN it SHALL use async file I/O methods instead of synchronous `open()` calls
2. WHEN creating backup files THEN the system SHALL use `aiofiles` or Home Assistant's async file utilities
3. WHEN reading configuration files THEN all file operations SHALL be non-blocking
4. WHEN the integration starts up THEN Home Assistant SHALL NOT generate "Detected blocking call" warnings

### Requirement 2: Fix Version Migration System

**User Story:** As a user upgrading Roost Scheduler, I want the migration system to correctly update my data version, so that my schedules remain accessible and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating from version 0.3.0 to 0.4.0 THEN the system SHALL correctly update the stored version to 0.4.0
2. WHEN migration validation runs THEN it SHALL pass with the correct target version
3. WHEN no migration function exists for a version THEN the system SHALL still update the version metadata correctly
4. WHEN migration completes THEN the stored data version SHALL match the expected target version

### Requirement 3: Fix Backup Recovery System

**User Story:** As a user experiencing data corruption, I want the backup recovery system to successfully restore my schedule data, so that I don't lose my configured schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system attempts to import a backup file THEN it SHALL handle different data types correctly without type errors
2. WHEN parsing backup data THEN the system SHALL validate data types before calling string methods
3. WHEN backup recovery fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue
4. WHEN multiple backup files exist THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery from the most recent valid backup first

### Requirement 4: Improve Data Integrity Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to detect and handle data corruption gracefully, so that my integration continues to function even when data issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating migrated data THEN the system SHALL check for required fields and correct data types
2. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery before failing
3. WHEN all recovery attempts fail THEN the system SHALL initialize with default data instead of crashing
4. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log specific details about what validation checks failed

### Requirement 5: Enhance Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer or advanced user troubleshooting issues, I want detailed error information and logging, so that I can understand and resolve problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the specific file path and error details
2. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL log the source version, target version, and failure reason
3. WHEN backup operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the backup file path and specific error
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log which validation checks failed and why
