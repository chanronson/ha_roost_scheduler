# Manager Integration Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical integration issues where the PresenceManager and BufferManager constructors don't match the parameters being passed from the main integration setup. This causes setup failures when users configure presence detection with multiple devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: PresenceManager Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a user configuring presence detection, I want my presence settings to be properly stored and loaded, so that my configuration persists across Home Assistant restarts and the integration setup completes successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PresenceManager is initialized THEN it SHALL accept a storage_service parameter for configuration persistence

2. WHEN presence entities are configured THEN the PresenceManager SHALL store the configuration using the storage service

3. WHEN the integration starts THEN the PresenceManager SHALL load its configuration from storage

4. WHEN presence configuration changes THEN the PresenceManager SHALL persist the changes to storage

5. WHEN the PresenceManager fails to load configuration THEN it SHALL use sensible defaults and log the issue

### Requirement 2: BufferManager Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a user with custom buffer settings, I want my buffer configuration to be properly stored and loaded, so that my buffer preferences persist across restarts and the integration setup completes successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BufferManager is initialized THEN it SHALL accept a storage_service parameter for configuration persistence

2. WHEN buffer settings are configured THEN the BufferManager SHALL store the configuration using the storage service

3. WHEN the integration starts THEN the BufferManager SHALL load its configuration from storage

4. WHEN buffer configuration changes THEN the BufferManager SHALL persist the changes to storage

5. WHEN the BufferManager fails to load configuration THEN it SHALL use sensible defaults and log the issue

### Requirement 3: Configuration Loading and Initialization

**User Story:** As a user setting up the integration, I want all managers to properly initialize with their stored configurations, so that my previous settings are restored and the setup process completes without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managers are initialized THEN they SHALL load their configuration from the shared storage service

2. WHEN configuration loading fails THEN managers SHALL initialize with default values and continue setup

3. WHEN managers are initialized THEN they SHALL validate their loaded configuration and fix any inconsistencies

4. WHEN configuration is missing THEN managers SHALL create default configuration and store it

### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As an existing user upgrading the integration, I want my current settings to be preserved during the upgrade, so that I don't lose my configuration when the storage integration is added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading from a version without storage integration THEN existing configurations SHALL be preserved

2. WHEN managers detect missing storage configuration THEN they SHALL migrate from any existing in-memory configuration

3. WHEN migration occurs THEN the system SHALL log the migration process for debugging

4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default configuration and continue operation

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user experiencing setup issues, I want clear error messages and automatic recovery, so that I can understand what went wrong and the integration can still function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN manager initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific problem

2. WHEN storage operations fail THEN managers SHALL continue operating with in-memory configuration

3. WHEN configuration corruption is detected THEN managers SHALL reset to defaults and log the issue

4. WHEN managers encounter initialization errors THEN they SHALL not prevent the overall integration setup from completing

### Requirement 6: Configuration Validation and Consistency

**User Story:** As a user with complex presence and buffer configurations, I want the system to validate my settings and ensure they work correctly together, so that I can trust the integration to behave predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN managers SHALL validate all settings for correctness and consistency

2. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN managers SHALL fix or reset the problematic settings

3. WHEN configuration conflicts are detected THEN managers SHALL resolve them using sensible defaults

4. WHEN validation fails THEN managers SHALL log detailed information about the issues found

### Requirement 7: Integration Setup Robustness

**User Story:** As a user setting up the integration, I want the setup process to be robust and handle various error conditions gracefully, so that I can successfully configure the integration even if some components have issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any manager fails to initialize THEN the integration setup SHALL continue with other managers

2. WHEN critical managers fail THEN the integration SHALL provide fallback functionality

3. WHEN setup encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to resolve them

4. WHEN setup completes with warnings THEN the system SHALL inform the user about any limitations or issues

### Requirement 8: Logging and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a user troubleshooting integration issues, I want comprehensive logging and diagnostic information, so that I can understand what's happening during setup and operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managers initialize THEN they SHALL log their initialization status and configuration summary

2. WHEN configuration is loaded or saved THEN managers SHALL log the operation results

3. WHEN errors occur THEN managers SHALL log detailed error information with context

4. WHEN diagnostic information is requested THEN managers SHALL provide comprehensive status reports
