# Config Flow Handler Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the "Config flow could not be loaded: Invalid handler specified" error that occurs when users try to add the Roost Scheduler integration through the Home Assistant UI. This error typically indicates issues with the config flow registration, domain configuration, or integration initialization that prevent Home Assistant from properly loading the configuration flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Config Flow Registration Validation

**User Story:** As a user trying to add the Roost Scheduler integration, I want the config flow to load properly in the Home Assistant UI, so that I can configure the integration without encountering "Invalid handler specified" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Home Assistant loads the integration THEN the config flow handler SHALL be properly registered with the correct domain
2. WHEN the integration is installed THEN the manifest.json domain SHALL match the DOMAIN constant in the code
3. WHEN the config flow class is defined THEN it SHALL properly inherit from config_entries.ConfigFlow
4. WHEN the config flow is registered THEN it SHALL use the correct domain parameter
5. WHEN Home Assistant validates the integration THEN all required config flow methods SHALL be present and properly implemented

### Requirement 2: Domain Configuration Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the integration, I want consistent domain configuration across all files, so that Home Assistant can properly identify and load the integration components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is loaded THEN the domain in manifest.json SHALL match the DOMAIN constant in const.py
2. WHEN the config flow is defined THEN it SHALL use the same domain as specified in the manifest
3. WHEN services are registered THEN they SHALL use the consistent domain identifier
4. WHEN the integration is initialized THEN all components SHALL reference the same domain
5. WHEN domain validation occurs THEN no conflicts or mismatches SHALL be detected

### Requirement 3: Integration Entry Point Validation

**User Story:** As a user installing the integration, I want the integration to properly initialize its entry points, so that Home Assistant can successfully load and register all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration loads THEN the __init__.py async_setup function SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN config entries are processed THEN the async_setup_entry function SHALL handle all initialization steps
3. WHEN the integration starts THEN all required imports SHALL be available and functional
4. WHEN dependencies are loaded THEN all required Home Assistant components SHALL be accessible
5. WHEN initialization fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be logged to help with troubleshooting

### Requirement 4: Config Flow Method Implementation

**User Story:** As a user configuring the integration, I want all config flow steps to work correctly, so that I can complete the setup process without encountering method-related errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the config flow starts THEN the async_step_user method SHALL be properly implemented and callable
2. WHEN config flow steps execute THEN all required methods SHALL be present and functional
3. WHEN form validation occurs THEN all validation methods SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN the config flow completes THEN it SHALL create a valid config entry
5. WHEN config flow errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled and reported appropriately

### Requirement 5: Manifest Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the integration manifest to be properly configured, so that Home Assistant can correctly identify and load the integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the manifest is parsed THEN it SHALL contain all required fields for a config flow integration
2. WHEN config_flow is specified THEN it SHALL be set to true in the manifest
3. WHEN dependencies are listed THEN they SHALL all be available in the Home Assistant installation
4. WHEN the integration type is specified THEN it SHALL be appropriate for the integration's functionality
5. WHEN the manifest is validated THEN no syntax or configuration errors SHALL be present

### Requirement 6: Import and Dependency Resolution

**User Story:** As a user with a standard Home Assistant installation, I want all integration dependencies to be properly resolved, so that the integration loads without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration loads THEN all Python imports SHALL resolve successfully
2. WHEN Home Assistant components are imported THEN they SHALL be available and compatible
3. WHEN custom modules are imported THEN they SHALL be present in the integration directory
4. WHEN circular imports are checked THEN none SHALL be present in the codebase
5. WHEN dependency conflicts occur THEN they SHALL be resolved or clearly reported

### Requirement 7: Config Flow Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user encountering setup issues, I want clear error messages and recovery options, so that I can understand and resolve configuration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN config flow initialization fails THEN specific error messages SHALL be logged
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be presented clearly to the user
3. WHEN recovery is possible THEN the config flow SHALL provide retry options
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the config flow SHALL fail gracefully with helpful messages
5. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN diagnostic information SHALL be available in the logs

### Requirement 8: Integration Registration Verification

**User Story:** As a developer debugging integration issues, I want to verify that all components are properly registered with Home Assistant, so that I can identify registration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration loads THEN it SHALL appear in Home Assistant's integration registry
2. WHEN the config flow is registered THEN it SHALL be discoverable by Home Assistant's config flow system
3. WHEN services are registered THEN they SHALL be available in Home Assistant's service registry
4. WHEN platforms are registered THEN they SHALL be properly associated with the integration
5. WHEN registration verification runs THEN all components SHALL report successful registration

### Requirement 9: File System and Permissions Validation

**User Story:** As a user with a custom Home Assistant installation, I want the integration to work regardless of file system permissions or installation method, so that I can use the integration in various deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration files are accessed THEN they SHALL be readable by the Home Assistant process
2. WHEN the integration directory is scanned THEN all required files SHALL be present
3. WHEN file permissions are checked THEN they SHALL allow proper integration loading
4. WHEN the integration is installed via HACS THEN it SHALL work identically to manual installation
5. WHEN file system issues are detected THEN clear error messages SHALL guide resolution

### Requirement 10: Version Compatibility Verification

**User Story:** As a user running a specific Home Assistant version, I want the integration to verify compatibility, so that I know if version-related issues might be causing the config flow problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration loads THEN it SHALL verify Home Assistant version compatibility
2. WHEN version incompatibilities are detected THEN clear warnings SHALL be provided
3. WHEN deprecated APIs are used THEN the integration SHALL handle them gracefully
4. WHEN version-specific features are accessed THEN availability SHALL be checked first
5. WHEN compatibility issues prevent operation THEN specific guidance SHALL be provided
