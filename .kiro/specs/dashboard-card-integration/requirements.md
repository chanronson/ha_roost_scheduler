# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the missing dashboard integration after completing the Roost Scheduler configuration wizard. Currently, users complete the setup process but find no card is automatically added to their Lovelace dashboard, and the Roost Scheduler card doesn't appear in the dashboard's "Add Card" picker. This creates a poor user experience where users have successfully configured the integration but cannot easily access or use the scheduling interface.

The feature will ensure seamless integration between the configuration wizard completion and dashboard card availability, providing users with immediate access to the Roost Scheduler interface after setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want the Roost Scheduler card to be automatically available in the dashboard card picker after completing the configuration wizard, so that I can immediately start using the scheduling interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Roost Scheduler integration is successfully configured THEN the system SHALL register the custom card with Home Assistant's frontend
2. WHEN a user opens the dashboard card picker THEN the system SHALL display "Roost Scheduler" as an available card option
3. WHEN the card registration fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages for troubleshooting
4. IF the card files are missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want a Roost Scheduler card to be automatically added to my dashboard after completing the configuration wizard, so that I don't have to manually search for and add the card myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the configuration wizard completes successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically add a Roost Scheduler card to the user's default dashboard
2. WHEN adding the card automatically THEN the system SHALL use sensible default configuration settings
3. IF the automatic card addition fails THEN the system SHALL fall back gracefully and ensure the card is still available in the picker
4. WHEN multiple dashboards exist THEN the system SHALL add the card to the main/default dashboard only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want clear feedback about the dashboard integration status during and after configuration, so that I understand whether the setup was successful and what my next steps are.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the configuration wizard completes THEN the system SHALL display a success message indicating the card has been added to the dashboard
2. WHEN the card registration succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide instructions on how to access the new card
3. IF the dashboard integration encounters issues THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN the setup completes THEN the system SHALL offer a direct link or button to navigate to the dashboard with the new card

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant administrator, I want the card registration to work correctly across different Home Assistant versions and configurations, so that all users can access the Roost Scheduler interface regardless of their setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration loads THEN the system SHALL verify Home Assistant frontend compatibility before registering the card
2. WHEN running on older Home Assistant versions THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle any API differences in card registration
3. WHEN custom dashboard configurations exist THEN the system SHALL respect existing dashboard layouts while adding the new card
4. IF the frontend resources are not properly loaded THEN the system SHALL retry registration with appropriate backoff strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting dashboard issues, I want comprehensive logging and diagnostic information about the card registration process, so that I can quickly identify and resolve integration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN card registration begins THEN the system SHALL log the registration attempt with relevant details
2. WHEN registration succeeds or fails THEN the system SHALL log the outcome with specific error codes or success indicators
3. WHEN frontend resources are loaded THEN the system SHALL log the resource loading status and any detected issues
4. IF registration fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including Home Assistant version, frontend status, and file availability
